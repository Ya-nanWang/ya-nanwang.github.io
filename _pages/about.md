<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD candidate at the **Leiden University Centre for Linguistics (LUCL)**, working in the areas of **psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics**. 

My study primarily focus on **speech production**. 

Using **ERP (Event-Related Potentials)**, I investigate how **Chinese verbs** are processed during language production, with a particular interest in the roles of **lexico-syntactic features**, **orthographic** and **phonological representations**. My broader goal is to better understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying the complexity of the Chinese language.<br><br>
